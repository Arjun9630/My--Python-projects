# Python Programming Journey ðŸš€

## Introduction

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository serves as a collection of my Python projects as I explore the programming language. I'm excited to share my progress and showcase the wonders of programming!  
You'll find my code examples and projects here!

Feel free to explore the repository!

## Projects Included

### Project 1: [Jarvis](https://github.com/Arjun9630/My--Python-projects/tree/main/Jarvis) - Your Personal Voice Assistant

**Description:**  
This is my first project in Python, where I have implemented a basic version of a personal voice assistant named **Jarvis**. Inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man movies, Jarvis can perform a variety of tasks based on voice commands.

**Current Features:**
- **Voice Activation and Deactivation:**  
  Jarvis can be activated by saying "Jarvis" or "Hey Jarvis" and deactivated by saying "Jarvis turn off."
  
- **Web Search Functionality:**  
  Jarvis can open Google and YouTube to perform searches based on voice input.
  
- **Voice Feedback:**  
  Jarvis responds with voice feedback, providing a dynamic interaction experience.

### Project 2: [Student Grade Management System](https://github.com/Arjun9630/My--Python-projects/tree/main/StudentGradeManagement) - Manage Student Records with Ease

**Description:**  
This project is a Python-based **Student Grade Management System** designed to handle student data efficiently. The system allows users to add, view, search, save, and load student records along with their grades. It assigns grades based on the average marks of the students.

**Current Features:**
- **Add Student Records:**  
  Input student name, roll number, and subject marks. The system calculates the grade based on average marks.
  
- **View Students:**  
  Display all student records, including names, roll numbers, subjects, marks, and their respective grades.
  
- **Search for a Student:**  
  Search for a specific student by name and roll number.

- **Save/Load Records:**  
  Save student records to a file and load them later using JSON serialization.
  
- **Grade Assignment:**  
  Automatically assigns grades based on the average score, with categories ranging from 'A' to 'F'.
