# Jarvis: Your Personal Voice Assistant

Welcome to the **Jarvis** repository! ðŸš€

## Introduction

Welcome to my Jarvis project! This repository contains the initial implementation of Jarvis, a personal voice assistant built using Python. Inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man movies, Jarvis is designed to assist with various tasks through voice commands.

As a beginner in voice assistant development, I am excited to share my progress and showcase the features Iâ€™ve implemented. From recognizing voice commands and providing voice feedback to performing web searches and other tasks, youâ€™ll find a variety of functionalities that make Jarvis an interactive and helpful assistant.

Feel free to explore the repository, dive into the code, and follow along with my development journey. Whether you're learning about voice assistants or curious about my project, I hope you find something useful and inspiring!

## Features Included

- **Voice Activation and Deactivation:**
  - Jarvis can be activated by saying commands like "Jarvis" or "Hey Jarvis." You can also turn it off by saying "Jarvis turn off."

- **Web Search Functionality:**
  - Jarvis can open Google and perform a search based on your voice commands.
  - It can also open YouTube and search for videos using your voice.

- **Voice Feedback:**
  - Jarvis provides voice feedback for its actions, making the interaction more dynamic and engaging.

- **Modular Code Structure:**
  - The project is organized into different methods for easy understanding and further development. This includes separate modules for listening, speaking, and command processing.

## Getting Started

To get started with Jarvis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
   cd jarvis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Add a `requirements.txt` file with necessary libraries like `pyttsx3`, `SpeechRecognition`, and `pyautogui`.)*

3. **Run Jarvis:**
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements

This project is still in its early stages. Here are some features I plan to add in the future:

- **Integration with more APIs:** 
  - Adding functionality to get weather updates, news, and more.
  
- **Improved Command Recognition:** 
  - Enhancing the natural language processing capabilities for better understanding and more dynamic responses.

- **Customizable Settings:**
  - Allowing users to set preferences like voice speed, activation phrases, and more.
