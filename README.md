Python Programming Journey:
Welcome to my Python Programming Journey repository! ðŸš€

Introduction
Welcome to my Python learning journey! ðŸš€ This repository serves as a collection of my Python programs, projects, and coding exercises as I explore and learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language.

As a beginner in Python, I'm excited to share my progress and showcase the various concepts and techniques I've been learning. From basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics, you'll find my code examples and mini projects here.

Feel free to explore the repository, dive into the code, and follow along with my learning journey. Whether you're also learning Python or just curious about my projects, I hope you find something useful and inspiring!

Projects Included

Project 1: Jarvis - Your Personal Voice Assistant
Description: This is my first project in Python, where I have implemented a basic version of a personal voice assistant named Jarvis. Inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man movies, Jarvis can perform a variety of tasks based on voice commands.

Current Features:

Voice Activation and Deactivation: Jarvis can be activated by saying "Jarvis" or "Hey Jarvis" and deactivated by saying "Jarvis turn off."
Web Search Functionality: Jarvis can open Google and YouTube to perform searches based on voice input.
Voice Feedback: Jarvis responds with voice feedback, providing a dynamic interaction experience.
