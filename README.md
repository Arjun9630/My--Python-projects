# Python Programming Journey ðŸš€

## Introduction

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository serves as a collection of my Python projects as I explore Python programming language!

I'm excited to share my progress and showcase the wonders of programming!! You'll find my code examples and projects here!

Feel free to explore the repository!!

## Projects Included

### Project 1: [Jarvis](https://github.com/Arjun9630/My--Python-projects/tree/main/Jarvis) - Your Personal Voice Assistant

**Description:**  
This is my first project in Python, where I have implemented a basic version of a personal voice assistant named **Jarvis**. Inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man movies, Jarvis can perform a variety of tasks based on voice commands.

**Current Features:**
- **Voice Activation and Deactivation:**  
  Jarvis can be activated by saying "Jarvis" or "Hey Jarvis" and deactivated by saying "Jarvis turn off."
  
- **Web Search Functionality:**  
  Jarvis can open Google and YouTube to perform searches based on voice input.
  
- **Voice Feedback:**  
  Jarvis responds with voice feedback, providing a dynamic interaction experience.
